Lecture 1: Operating System Structures 
1. What is an Operating System (OS)? 
• 
Definition: An OS is software that manages hardware resources and provides services 
for application programs. It acts as an intermediary between users and the computer 
hardware. 
• 
Functions: 
o 
Allocates resources (CPU, memory, storage). 
o 
Manages execution of processes. 
o 
Provides interfaces (e.g., graphical or command-line). 
Examples: 
• 
Windows facilitates user interaction with a graphical interface. 
• 
Linux is widely used for servers due to its efficiency. 
 
2. Objectives of an Operating System 
• 
Convenience: Makes computing easier with interfaces (e.g., Windows' Start menu). 
• 
Efficiency: Ensures optimal resource utilization. 
o 
Example: Multitasking in Linux uses CPU cycles efficiently. 
• 
Security: Protects user data and prevents unauthorized access. 
o 
Example: Android restricts app permissions to protect user privacy. 
• 
Flexibility: Allows system updates and adaptations without major disruptions. 
o 
Example: macOS regularly adds new features while maintaining stability. 
 
3. Services Provided by an OS 
• 
Program Development: Includes tools like editors and compilers. 
o 
Example: Windows provides Notepad and Visual Studio for programming. 
• 
Program Execution: Loads programs, initializes the environment, and schedules 
execution. 
o 
Example: The Task Manager in Windows allows users to view and manage 
running processes. 
• 
Error Handling: Detects and manages software and hardware errors. 
o 
Example: A "blue screen" in Windows alerts users of critical failures.

4. Types of Computer Systems Managed by OS 
1. Batch Systems: Process jobs sequentially in batches without user interaction, 
maximizing resource utilization (e.g., early payroll systems). 
2. Multi-Programmed Batch Systems: Handle multiple programs in memory, using 
job scheduling to optimize CPU and I/O usage (e.g., one program processes 
while another waits for I/O). 
3. Time-Sharing Systems: Enable multiple users to interact simultaneously with 
rapid switching between jobs for low response times (e.g., Unix systems). 
4. Personal Computer Systems: Designed for single users with dedicated 
hardware; data sharing possible via networking (e.g., Windows and macOS 
desktops). 
5. Distributed Systems: Networked computers operate as a cohesive system; 
examples include cloud computing with client-server or peer-to-peer setups. 
6. Parallel Systems: Utilize multiple CPUs to process independent tasks 
concurrently, ideal for high-performance applications like scientific simulations 
(e.g., supercomputers). 
7. Clustered Systems: Multiple systems work together, sharing resources to 
enhance reliability; can be asymmetric (standby systems) or symmetric (all 
active) (e.g., high-availability server clusters). 
8. Real-Time Systems: Operate under strict timing constraints for critical 
applications: 
o Hard Real-Time: Guarantees timely task completion (e.g., industrial 
robots). 
o Soft Real-Time: Prioritizes tasks without strict timing guarantees (e.g., 
multimedia systems). 
9. Handheld Systems: Feature limited resources and compact designs for mobile 
use (e.g., smartphones and tablets). 
10. Hybrid Systems: Combine features from various system types for versatility, 
such as batch processing with time-sharing (e.g., Linux).

Lecture 3 & 4: Process Management 
I. Processes 
Process Concept 
• 
A Process is a program in execution, which is the entity assigned to processors. 
• 
Terms "job" and "process" are often used interchangeably. 
Process States 
• 
New: Process is being created. 
• 
Running: Instructions are being executed (has the CPU). 
• 
Waiting (Blocked): Process is waiting for an event (e.g., I/O completion). 
• 
Ready: Process is ready to use the CPU. 
• 
Terminated: Process has finished execution. 
Process Control Block (PCB)
By:Mo’Men_el_Sayed 
7 
• 
Also known as "process descriptor." 
• 
Contains:  
o 
Current state 
o 
Unique identification 
o 
Pointers to parent and child processes 
o 
Pointers to allocated resources (e.g., memory range) 
o 
CPU scheduling information 
Process Scheduling Queues 
• 
Job Queue: All processes in the system. 
• 
Ready Queue: Processes ready to execute. 
• 
Device Queues: Processes waiting for I/O devices. 
• 
Processes migrate between these queues. 
Schedulers 
• 
Long-term Scheduler (Job Scheduler): Decides which processes to bring into the ready 
queue. 
• 
Short-term Scheduler (CPU Scheduler): Decides which process to execute next. 
• 
Medium-term Scheduler: Handles processes that need to be swapped out. 
Operations on Processes 
• 
Create, destroy, suspend, resume, change priority, block, wake up, dispatch, and enable 
interprocess communication. 
Process Creation 
• 
Steps:  
o 
Define the process name. 
o 
Insert it into the process table. 
o 
Set initial priority and create the PCB. 
o 
Allocate initial resources. 
• 
Parent Process: Creates a child process. 
• 
Resource Sharing:  
o 
Parent and child can share all resources, some, or none. 
o 
Parent and children execute concurrently. 
Process Termination
By:Mo’Men_el_Sayed 
8 
• 
Involves removing the process from the system, returning resources, and erasing the 
PCB. 
Threads 
• 
A Thread (lightweight process) is a basic unit of CPU utilization, sharing code, data, and 
OS resources. 
• 
Multiple threads can run concurrently, improving performance (e.g., Producer-
Consumer Problem). 
• 
Types:  
o 
Kernel-level threads: Managed by the OS. 
o 
User-level threads: Managed by user-level libraries. 
o 
Hybrid: Combines both. 
Interprocess Communication (IPC) 
• 
Mechanism for processes to communicate and synchronize. 
• 
Message System: Processes communicate without shared variables. 
• 
Operations:  
o 
send(message) 
o 
receive(message) 
Logical IPC 
• 
Communication can be direct or indirect. 
• 
Can be symmetric or asymmetric, with various buffering strategies. 
Direct Communication 
• 
Processes must name each other explicitly:  
o 
send(P, message) to send to process P. 
o 
receive(Q, message) to receive from Q. 
Indirect Communication 
• 
Messages are sent and received from mailboxes (ports). 
• 
Operations include creating, sending, receiving, and destroying mailboxes. 
Buffering Strategies 
1. Zero Capacity: Sender waits for receiver. 
2. Bounded Capacity: Finite length; sender waits if full.
By:Mo’Men_el_Sayed 
9 
3. Unbounded Capacity: Infinite; sender never waits. 
 
II. CPU Scheduling 
Basic Concepts 
• 
CPU Scheduling maximizes CPU utilization. 
• 
Processes cycle through CPU usage and I/O usage. 
CPU Burst Times 
• 
Described as:  
o 
I/O-bound processes: Short CPU bursts. 
o 
CPU-bound processes: Long CPU bursts. 
Preemptive vs. Nonpreemptive Scheduling 
• 
Nonpreemptive: Once a process has the CPU, it cannot be taken away. 
• 
Preemptive: The CPU can be taken away, useful for high-priority processes. 
Scheduling Criteria 
• 
CPU Utilization: Keep CPU busy. 
• 
Throughput: Number of processes completed per time unit. 
• 
Turnaround Time: Total time to execute a process. 
• 
Waiting Time: Time a process waits in the ready queue. 
• 
Response Time: Time from request submission to first response. 
Optimization Criteria 
• 
Maximize CPU utilization and throughput. 
• 
Minimize turnaround, waiting, and response times. 
Priorities 
• 
Assigned automatically or externally; can be static (unchanging) or dynamic 
(changeable).

Scheduling Algorithms 
1. First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) Scheduling 
Description: Processes are dispatched in the order they arrive. It is a non-preemptive 
scheduling method. 
Example: 
• 
Processes:  
o 
P1: 24 ms 
o 
P2: 3 ms 
o 
P3: 3 ms  
| P1 | P2 | P3 | 
0    24   27   30 
Waiting Times: 
• 
P1: 0 ms 
• 
P2: 24 ms 
• 
P3: 27 ms 
• 
Average Waiting Time: (0 + 24 + 27) / 3 = 17 ms 
2. Round Robin (RR) Scheduling 
Description: Each process gets a fixed time slice (quantum). If the process does not 
finish in its time slice, it is placed at the end of the queue. 
Example: 
• 
Processes:  
o 
P1: 53 ms 
o 
P2: 17 ms 
o 
P3: 68 ms 
o 
P4: 24 ms 
• 
Time Quantum: 20 ms 
| P1 | P2 | P3 | P4 | P1 | P3 |
By:Mo’Men_el_Sayed 
11 
0    20   37   57   77   93  111 
Performance: 
• 
Guarantees reasonable response time. 
• 
The overhead should be minimized. 
3. Shortest Job First (SJF) Scheduling 
Description: The process with the smallest estimated run time is executed next. Can be 
preemptive or non-preemptive. 
Example: 
• 
Processes:  
o 
P1: 8 ms 
o 
P2: 4 ms 
o 
P3: 9 ms 
o 
P4: 5 ms 
Non-Preemptive 
| P2 | P4 | P1 | P3 | 
0    4    9   17   26 
Waiting Times: 
• 
P1: 9 ms 
• 
P2: 0 ms 
• 
P3: 17 ms 
• 
P4: 4 ms 
• 
Average Waiting Time: (9 + 0 + 17 + 4) / 4 = 7.5 ms 
4. Priority Scheduling 
Description: Each process is assigned a priority. The CPU is allocated to the process 
with the highest priority (smallest integer). 
Example:
By:Mo’Men_el_Sayed 
12 
• 
Processes:  
o 
P1: 10 ms (Priority 2) 
o 
P2: 1 ms (Priority 1) 
o 
P3: 2 ms (Priority 3) 
| P2 | P3 | P1 | 
0    1    3    13 
Waiting Times: 
• 
P1: 3 ms 
• 
P2: 0 ms 
• 
P3: 1 ms 
• 
Average Waiting Time: (3 + 0 + 1) / 3 = 1.33 ms 
Summary of Key Points 
• 
FCFS: Simple but can lead to long waiting times for short processes. 
• 
RR: Fair sharing of CPU time, good for time-sharing systems. 
• 
SJF: Optimal for minimizing average waiting time but can cause starvation. 
• 
Priority Scheduling: Can solve starvation with aging techniques. 
Lecture 5:Deadlocks 
 1. Deadlock Problem 
Example Scenario 
• 
System: Two tape drives. 
• 
Processes:  
o 
P1 holds Tape Drive 1 and waits for Tape Drive 2. 
o 
P2 holds Tape Drive 2 and waits for Tape Drive 1. 
P1: Holds Tape Drive 1 -------> Waits for Tape Drive 2 
P2: Holds Tape Drive 2 -------> Waits for Tape Drive 1 
2. Bridge Crossing Example 
Example Scenario 
• 
Traffic: Only flows in one direction on a bridge. 
• 
Resource: Each section of the bridge acts as a resource.
By:Mo’Men_el_Sayed 
13 
• 
Deadlock: If multiple cars reach the bridge and block each other, they must back up to 
free the bridge. 
Cars (C1, C2, C3) reach the bridge: 
C1 <------ C2 <------ C3 
If C2 wants to go forward but is blocked by C1, a deadlock occurs. 
3. Resource Allocation Graph (RAG) 
Example Scenario 
• 
Processes: P1 and P2. 
• 
Resources: R1 and R2. 
Graph: 
• 
P1 requests R1, and R2 is held by P2. 
• 
P2 requests R2, and R1 is held by P1. 
P1 ---> R1 (holds) 
P2 ---> R2 (holds) 
• 
Circular Wait: P1 waits for R2, and P2 waits for R1. 
4. Deadlock Prevention Example 
Scenario 
• 
Hold and Wait Prevention: Require processes to request all resources before execution. 
Example: 
• 
Process P1 must request both Tape Drive 1 and Tape Drive 2 before it starts executing. 
5. Deadlock Avoidance Example 
Banker's Algorithm Scenario 
• 
Processes: P1 and P2. 
• 
Resource Requirements:  
o 
P1: Maximum 3 units of resource A.
By:Mo’Men_el_Sayed 
14 
o 
P2: Maximum 2 units of resource A. 
• 
Available Resources: 2 units of A. 
Safe State Example: 
• 
If P1 requests 2 units and gets them, it can finish and release resources, allowing P2 to 
then finish. 
Available: 2 units 
P1: Needs 1 more to finish 
P2: Can be satisfied after P1 finishes 
6. Deadlock Detection Example 
Scenario 
• 
Wait-For Graph:  
o 
P1 waits for P2. 
o 
P2 waits for P1. 
P1 ---> P2 
P2 ---> P1 
 
• 
This cycle indicates a deadlock. 
7. Recovery from Deadlock Example 
Process Termination 
• 
Scenario: Abort one process at a time until the deadlock is resolved. 
Example: 
• 
If P1 and P2 are deadlocked, abort P1 first, check if the deadlock is resolved.
By:Mo’Men_el_Sayed 
15 
8. Resource Preemption Example 
Scenario 
• 
Victim Selection: Choose a process to preempt based on resource usage and priority. 
 
 
Lecture 7 & 8: Memory Management and Virtual Memory 
1. Background 
• 
Programs need to be brought into memory for execution. 
• 
Input Queue: A collection of processes waiting on disk to be loaded into 
memory. 
• 
Motivation: Multiple processes in memory improve system performance. 
• 
Memory is a large array of words/bytes, each with a unique address. 
• 
Memory management methods are dependent on both application and 
hardware. 
• 
Challenge: Memory is often insufficient to meet demands, necessitating 
advanced management techniques. 
 
2. Binding of Instructions and Data to Memory 
• 
Compile Time: 
o Memory location is predetermined. 
o Changes require recompilation. 
o Example: MSDOS system files. 
• 
Load Time: 
o Addresses determined during loading. 
o Relocation addresses are fixed for runtime. 
o Example: MSDOS applications (historically). 
• 
Execution Time: 
o Binding is delayed until runtime. 
o Allows processes to move during execution. 
o Common in modern multitasking systems like UNIX and Windows.
By:Mo’Men_el_Sayed 
16 
3. Logical vs. Physical Address Space 
• 
Logical Address: Generated by the CPU. 
• 
Physical Address: Corresponds to an actual memory location. 
• 
Logical and physical addresses: 
o Are identical in compile-time binding. 
o Differ in load-time and execution-time binding. 
Memory Management Unit (MMU): 
• 
A hardware device that maps logical to physical addresses. 
• 
Relocation Register: 
o Value added to logical addresses to produce physical addresses. 
o User programs deal only with logical addresses. 
 
4. Techniques in Memory Management 
• 
Dynamic Loading: 
o Routines are loaded only when called. 
o Improves memory utilization. 
o Ideal for large programs handling infrequent cases. 
• 
Dynamic Linking: 
o Frequently used routines are not linked into the program but accessed 
via a stub. 
o Advantages: 
▪ 
Saves memory space. 
▪ 
Updates to shared libraries benefit all applications. 
o Disadvantages: 
▪ 
New library bugs affect all dependent applications. 
• 
Overlays: 
o Only required instructions and data are loaded into memory. 
o Useful when process size exceeds available memory. 
o Complex to implement without OS support.
By:Mo’Men_el_Sayed 
17 
5. Contiguous Allocation 
• 
Single Partition: 
o OS resides in low memory; user processes in high memory. 
o Protects user processes from each other. 
• 
Multiple Partition: 
o Memory divided into variable-sized holes. 
o Allocation Strategies: 
1. First-Fit: Allocates the first available hole. 
2. Best-Fit: Allocates the smallest hole sufficient for the request. 
3. Worst-Fit: Allocates the largest available hole. 
• 
Fragmentation: 
o External: Non-contiguous free memory blocks. 
o Internal: Allocated memory exceeds process requirements. 
o Compaction: 
1. Rearranges memory to consolidate free space. 
2. Requires dynamic relocation. 
 
6. Swapping 
• 
Temporarily moves processes from memory to backing store and back. 
• 
Backing Store: 
o High-speed disk to store memory images. 
• 
Roll Out, Roll In: 
o Swaps out lower-priority processes for higher-priority ones. 
• 
Swap time is proportional to the amount of memory swapped. 
• 
Examples: UNIX uses separate partitions; Windows uses a swap file. 
 
7. Paging 
• 
Divides memory into fixed-sized frames and logical memory into pages. 
• 
Page Table: 
o Maps logical to physical addresses. 
o Consists of a Page-Table Base Register (PTBR) and Page-Table Length 
Register (PRLR). 
• 
Address Translation:
By:Mo’Men_el_Sayed 
18 
o CPU address split into Page Number (p) and Page Offset (d). 
o Physical address = Base address (from page table) + Offset. 
• 
Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB): 
o Cache for frequently used page-table entries. 
o Reduces memory access time. 
 
8. Segmentation 
• 
Divides programs into segments based on logical units (e.g., procedures, 
arrays). 
• 
Segment Table: 
o Maps segment numbers to physical addresses. 
o Contains: 
▪ 
Base: Starting physical address of the segment. 
▪ 
Limit: Segment length. 
• 
Segmentation with Paging: 
o Segments are further divided into pages to solve fragmentation issues. 
o Example: MULTICS system. 
 
9. Virtual Memory 
• 
Allows separation of logical memory from physical memory. 
• 
Demand Paging: 
o Pages loaded only when needed. 
o Reduces memory and I/O requirements. 
o Page Fault: 
▪ 
Occurs when a required page is not in memory. 
▪ 
Handled by fetching the page from the backing store. 
• 
Page Replacement: 
o Decides which page to replace when memory is full. 
o Uses Modify (Dirty) Bit to minimize overhead. 
Page Replacement Algorithms: 
1. FIFO: Replaces the oldest page. 
2. Optimal: Replaces the page not used for the longest time.
By:Mo’Men_el_Sayed 
19 
3. LRU: Replaces the least recently accessed page.

Question 1: Choose the correct answer (30 marks, 1 mark for each) 
1. Turnaround time is the amount of time to execute a particular process while 
waiting time is the amount of time a process has been waiting in the ready 
queue. 
2. The Paging approach resolved the external fragmentation problem while 
internal fragmentation is resolved by segmentation. 
3. In Parallel systems, a job should be split into small dependent jobs. 
4. In memory allocations, Best-fit and Worst-fit are better than First-fit in terms of 
speed and storage utilization. 
5. Hold-and-wait condition is to allow one or more processes to hold I/O device(s) 
and wait for another I/O device(s). 
6. MULTICS solved the problems of external fragmentation and lengthy search 
times by paging the segments. 
7. Executing an illegal instruction is considered as an interrupt. 
8. Time-sharing systems are suitable for Mainframes. 
9. In the asynchronous I/O structure, control is only returned after I/O is complete. 
10. Collecting statistics and monitoring performance are essential parts of any 
operating system. 
11. System calls provide the interface between a running program and the 
operating system. 
12. The interrupt service routine contains the addresses of the interrupt vectors.
By:Mo’Men_el_Sayed 
117 
13. In Simple batch systems, the transition between jobs should be as smooth as 
possible. 
14. Module Kernel is responsible for memory management. 
15. To keep track of the segment table, we use a Limit register that holds the 
smallest legal physical memory address while the base register contains the 
size of the range. 
16. A child process may not be destroyed when its parent process is destroyed. 
17. In a multiple-threaded task, while one thread is blocked and waiting, a second 
thread in the same task can proceed. 
18. Preemptive is useful in systems in which high-priority processes require rapid 
attention. 
1. Ans: True: Turnaround time includes execution and waiting, while waiting time is 
only the time spent waiting in the ready queue. 
2. False: The Paging approach resolved the external fragmentation problem, but 
internal fragmentation is resolved by paging itself, not segmentation. 
3. True: In parallel systems, a job should be split into smaller dependent tasks that 
can run concurrently. 
4. False: In memory allocation, Best-fit and Worst-fit are often slower than First-
fit due to more complex searching methods, even though they can improve 
storage utilization. 
5. True: Hold-and-wait condition allows one or more processes to hold I/O devices 
and wait for another device. 
6. False: MULTICS did not solve problems by paging the segments; it used 
segmentation along with paging to address fragmentation and other issues. 
7. True: Executing an illegal instruction generates an interrupt (exception) that 
requires the operating system’s intervention. 
8. False: Time-sharing systems are not specifically designed for mainframes, 
although they can be used on mainframes. They are more suited for systems 
with multiple users. 
9. False: In asynchronous I/O, control returns immediately to the program while 
the I/O operation is being performed in the background. 
10. True: Collecting statistics and monitoring performance are vital parts of any 
operating system for optimization and fault detection. 
11. True: System calls provide an interface between running programs and the 
operating system for resource access. 
12. False: Interrupt service routines do not contain addresses of the interrupt 
vectors. The interrupt vector table holds those addresses.
By:Mo’Men_el_Sayed 
118 
13. True: In simple batch systems, transitions between jobs should be smooth to 
ensure efficient use of resources. 
14. False: The kernel is responsible for many functions, but memory management 
specifically is handled by the memory manager. 
15. False: The base register holds the starting address of a segment, and the limit 
register holds its size. The description in the statement is reversed. 
16. True: A child process may continue executing even if its parent process is 
destroyed, though it may become orphaned. 
17. True: In a multi-threaded environment, while one thread is blocked, other 
threads can continue execution. 
18. True: Preemptive scheduling is effective for giving high-priority processes rapid 
attention in a system.
